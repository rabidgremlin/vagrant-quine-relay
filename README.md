Vagrant config to run the awesome [Quine Relay](https://github.com/mame/quine-relay)

To use:

1. install [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/)
2. switch to folder containing *Vagrantfile* and *bootstrap.sh*
3. Run *vagrant up* Config should install all required files and run the process
4. Check out *qr* folder for the resulting source files

**Note:** The run currently crashes out with an error during the Fortran compile... not sure why
